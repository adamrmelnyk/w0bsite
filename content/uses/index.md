## Hardware I use

* I use a Desktop running Pop_OS from System76 after a long stint using some flavour of Ubuntu since about 2008.
* I use a Dell Ultrasharp 34 monitor that never feels large enough.
* I have two Raspberry Pi's I use to run my own DNS at home.
* I have a pair of Sony MDR7506's that I've been using since about 2010.
* I use a Happy Hacking keyboard.

## Software I use

* IntelliJ for Java, Vim, VSCode for almost everything else.
* I use Spotify for music.
* I use FireFox for most web browsing, sometimes lynx.
* I use git for version control.
* I use Java, Bash, Python, Ruby professionally, but I have used Rust and Racket in my spare time.
